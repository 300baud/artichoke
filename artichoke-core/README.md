# artichoke-core

artichoke-core crate provides a set of traits that, when implemented, create a
complete Ruby interpreter.

artichoke-core is a work in progress. When fully functioning, artichoke-core
will provide interpreter-agnostic implementations of Ruby Core and Ruby Standard
Library that pass ruby/spec if an interpreter implements all of the required
traits.

The evolution of artichoke-core can be tracked in
[Milestone 2, ruby/spec: Core](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/milestones/2)
and
[Milestone 3, ruby/spec: Standard Library](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/milestones/3).
