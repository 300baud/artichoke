Artichoke is a Ruby implementation written in Rust and Ruby. Artichoke intends
to be [MRI-compatible](https://github.com/ruby/spec) and targets Ruby 2.6.3.
Artichoke provides a Ruby runtime implemented in Rust and Ruby.

You can [try Artichoke in your browser](https://artichoke.run). The
[Artichoke Playground](https://github.com/artichoke/playground) runs a
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) build of Artichoke.

## Install Artichoke

You can install a pre-release build of Artichoke using `cargo`, Rust's package
manager, by running:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke --locked
```

If instead you'd like to build Artichoke locally, you'll need Rust, clang, and
Ruby. [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) has more detail on
[how to set up the compiler toolchain](BUILD.md#prerequisites).

## Usage

Artichoke ships with two binaries: `airb` and `artichoke`.

### `airb`

`airb` is the Artichoke implementation of `irb` and is an interactive Ruby shell
and [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

`airb` is a readline-enabled shell, although it does not persist history.

## `artichoke`

`artichoke` is the `ruby` binary frontend to Artichoke.

`artichoke` supports executing programs via files, stdin, or inline with one or
more `-e` flags.

Artichoke does not yet support local filesystem access. A temporary workaround
is to inject data into the interpreter with the `--with-fixture` flag, which
reads file contents into a `$fixture` global.

```console
$ artichoke --help
artichoke 0.1.0-pre.0
Artichoke is a Ruby made with Rust.

USAGE:
    artichoke [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [--] [programfile]

FLAGS:
        --copyright    print the copyright
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -V, --version      Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -e <commands>...                one line of script. Several -e's allowed. Omit [programfile]
        --with-fixture <fixture>    file whose contents will be read into the `$fixture` global

ARGS:
    <programfile>
```

## Design and Goals

Artichoke is [designed to enable experimentation](VISION.md). The top goals of
the project are:

- [Support WebAssembly as a build target](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/O-wasm-unknown).
- Support embedding and executing Ruby in untrusted environments.
- [Distribute Ruby applications as single-binary artifacts](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/A-single-binary).
- [Implement Ruby with state-of-the-art dependencies](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/A-deps).
- Experiment with VMs to support
  [dynamic codegen](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/A-codegen),
  [ahead of time compilation](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/A-compiler),
  [parallelism and eliminating the GIL](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/A-parallelism),
  and novel
  [memory management and garbage collection techniques](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/A-memory-management).

## Contributing

Artichoke aspires to be a Ruby 2.6.3-compatible implementation of the Ruby
programming language.
[There is lots to do](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues).

If Artichoke does not run Ruby source code in the same way that MRI does, it is
a bug and we would appreciate if you
[filed an issue so we can fix it](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues/new).

If you would like to contribute code üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an issue that looks interesting
and leave a comment that you're beginning to investigate. If there is no issue,
please file one before beginning to work on a PR.
[Good first issues are labeled `E-easy`](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/labels/E-easy).
